# Altera-CPU-Simulator
An online simulator for the Altera Digital Logic Lab CPU

## Getting Started

To use this tool, head over to [this link](https://rates37.github.io/Altera_CPU_Sim/).


## Why

This was used as a teaching tool to help students in the Monash class "ECE2072: Digital Systems" understand how a basic CPU data path works. This tool allows the user to step through clock cycles, and observe the values in all data path components (registers, wires, bus, control signals, etc.).
